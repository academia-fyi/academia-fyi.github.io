# academia.fyi

Academia is an incredible place. **However**, it still retains significant hidden curricula, underwhelming compensation, and a tremendous power imbalance between students and the university (among many, many other aspects).

`academia.fyi` aims to collect anonymous data from students, postdocs, and faculty about their unverisity's environment to aid each in their search for academies aligned with their goals *and to make plain where their current insitutes are lacking relative to others*.
